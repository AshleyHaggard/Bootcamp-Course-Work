    <h2>Heisenberg</h2>

    <p class="quote">I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric 
    acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that. How about something 
    with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? How are you even alive?</p>

    <p>That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus there's an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, 
    you've earned it. We made a deal. That's right. Because I think that we can do business together - we came to an 
    understanding. Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds 
    a week, thirty-five thousand a pound.</p>
            
    <p>Look... I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but once more, I shall try. This fly is a major problem 
    for us. It will ruin our batch. And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can cook. Failing that, we're dead. 
    There's no more room for error. Not with these people.</p>

    <p class="quote">Don't talk to me about hours, what about sudo, man? How are we gonna get that? You think the meth fairy is gonna just bring 
    it to us? God it takes me a week to get this stuff. I'm driving all the way up to Las Cruces, two hundred miles each way to meet 
    up with my Smurfs. The dudes who go to the drug stores and get a couple boxes at a time and then sell 'em to me. And that's maybe 
    only good for, like a half pound worth. See that's the bottle neck in your brilliant business plan. Of course you would've known 
    that if you would've just asked me.</p>

    <p>Oh well, heil Hitler, bitch! And let me tell you something else. So what're you saying? Like, I shot someone with, like, a gun? 
    We flipped a coin, okay? You and me. You and me! Coin flip is sacred! Your job is waiting for you in that basement, as per the coin!</p>

    <p>Four pounds... foooour pounds as if two pounds wasn't bad enough. we're talking two three hundred boxes of sinus pills there ain't 
    that many Smurfs in the world. So no sudo? So you do have a plan! Yeah, Mr. White! Yeah, science!</p>
